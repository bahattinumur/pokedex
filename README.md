<h1>POKEDEX</h1>

It's time to refresh memories with the Pokédex. After entering the name of your favorite Pokémon in the input field, you will see an image card featuring that specific Pokémon. This card will include information such as its experience, weight, and type (fire, water, electric, etc.). You can view these cards either as normal images or in a pixelated style.
